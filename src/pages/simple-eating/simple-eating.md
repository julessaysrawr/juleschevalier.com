### Tips:


Forget about eating certain foods for certain meals.  If I want eggs, I eat them for any meal.  If I have chicken and spinach cooked, I eat that for my first meal of the day.

Figure out what your body does best with.  How many meals does your body need?  Snacks?  Eating window?

If you’re having any kind of food difficulties, I recommend an elimination diet to find out what your body doesn’t like.

Do what works for you!  _Ignore this completely if it doesn’t work for you._
