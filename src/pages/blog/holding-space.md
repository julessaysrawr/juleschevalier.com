I seek those who can hold space for me, so I can hold space for others.

What is holding space?

- Let go of judgement and have unconditional positive regard.
- Open your heart; listen to understand.
- Let them have whatever experience they are having.  Let them express and feel their feelings.
- Be fully present.  Don’t try to fix them.

Ask “What is your experience?”

While holding space, it is important to breathe, ground, and be present with yourself.  Their pain is not yours to take on.  It is their experience to have and learn from.

The more I hold space for myself, the more I can hold space for others.
