The greeting "Hey Guys" assumes male is the default gender.  It says to women, trans and non-binary people that they are not important enough to be mentioned or included in a greeting.  It perpetuates the patriarchy and is also transphobic.  Imagine saying “Hey Guys” to a group that included a trans woman; that would be a micro-aggression.  It makes you wonder why gender needs to be a part of a greeting in the first place?  It doesn't –  and you can find some ideas of what to say instead below.

So much of our language centers on gender, which often does not need to be included at all.  The reason we use this phrase as a default is because it is casual and easy.  Doing what is easy keeps oppressive systems in power.  It takes effort to be intersectional and inclusive.  Let's be more intentional about our language so we do not cause harm to others.

## Ways to greet a group of people

- #### Hey y’all / you all
People from outside the southern states need to push through their hold up that this is only a southern phrase.  This is the *best* gender inclusive greeting that rolls off the tongue.  Our language should evolve, and yankees saying y’all should be normalized.

- #### Hello there

- #### Hey folks / folx
Side note: [Folx](https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/folx/) is a variation of the word folks that is meant to be a gender neutral way to refer to members of the LGBTQIA+ community.  It comes from Lantinx with is a gender neutral way to say Latino or Latina.

## One more thing: replace other gendered phrasing
If you use the following phrases, note how they are very gendered.
- Hey girl / boy
- You go, girl / boy
- You’re my girl / boy
- That’s my girl / boy
- My girls / boys

Instead, you can say
- #### Hey person / human / friend / mate
- #### You go person / human / friend / mate
- #### You’re my person / human / friend / mate
- #### That’s my person / human / friend / mate
- #### My persons / humans / friends / mates
