Coming back from crisis is tough.  That moment when you realize you are in over your head and not coping well.  When your emotions are so overwhelming that your ability to think logically is impaired.  We’ve all been there.  Maybe it was a perfect storm of circumstances.  Maybe something important went seriously wrong.  Whatever the cause, having a plan of how to navigate back to calm or even just okay is crucial in the moment.  Having a plan of what to do when you’re not thinking clearly will allow you to take action without having to decide anything.

Let someone know you are not okay.  Reaching out to someone you trust can make you feel less alone and emotionally supported.  Hearing that you are not irrational it can help to put you at ease.  

Remind yourself what is going well.  Today might have gone to shit, but there are many joyous aspects in your life.  Giving them acknowledgement and focus will redirect your energy towards the positive.
