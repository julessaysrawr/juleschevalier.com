The nostalgia of childhood is linked with the pop culture of the time, yet somehow, at least personally, the connection to video games runs deeper.  I have gone back many times over the years to revisit those simple and constrained worlds.  Playing Super Mario World, Donkey Kong Country and Zelda: A Link to the Past was the first time I got a glimpse into another world.  It was during those formative years that video games and I became good acquaintances.  </p>
<p>A deeper relationship with video games really started with World of Warcraft.  I was in my early 20s in the mid 2000s, when a boyfriend got me playing WoW with him.  MMOs were a whole world that I didn’t know existed.  I loved the character creation, the time debating what race and role you wanted to play.  I thrived in the adventure of quests, the challenge of raids, and took to guild life naturally.  Outside the game, my 20s was a decade when I was mostly lost.  I was trying to deprogram myself from a childhood filled with abuse.  I was trying to figure out who I was and what I wanted.  I was trying to make up for lost time of not being allowed to have friends and stay out late.  Most of all, I was trying to be okay on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>At first, I was shy and only played with that boyfriend.  In time, after we had joined a raiding guild, I made my own friends and really carved out my own space.  At the time, I was working a full time and part time job, and raiding another 30-40 hours a week.  When I moved back to New England, I knew that playing WoW was a lifestyle choice that I couldn’t continue with.  So I organically moved on.</p>
<p>A few years passed, and I was gifted a Wii.  While it was fun, I found I most enjoyed using it to play those old Super Nintendo games that I had play so many times before.  Due to a temporary rekindling with the abusive parent, those were tough years.  Little my little, I found my way, found great friends, and life kept getting better.</p>
<p>Then Skyrim happened.  We were over at family’s house for Thanksgiving.  My brother-in-law was playing this game that instantly captivated me.  I played for several hours that day on his console, and the next day bought my first xbox on black Friday (which I usually avoid).  Skyrim had been out for a year by then, but these things weren’t anywhere near my radar at that point.  </p>
<p>This began a relationship that would forever change the course of and the way I think about life.  I played a lot.  Found other people that played and bonded over it.  I probably immersed myself in Skyrim more than WoW.  In this case though, it was a solo adventure.</p>
<p>By this time, Game of Throne was on it’s second season and I had begun to reevaluate how I felt about the fantasy genre.  Up until this point, high fantasy was something I made fun of (the irony looking back!)  I spent a lot of time thinking about what class of character I would be in real life.  I got a chance to really know what kind what class of character I liked to play: spell caster, mage, warlock.  </p>
<p>At the same time as I was getting deeper into Skyrim, I had a major decision to make about my career path.  Would I go forward in the path I had spent years preparing for?  Or go a new path that I felt a calling to that I had only played with a short time?  I dug deep, soul searched, and overanalyzed.  I asked myself, what kind of character did I want to be?  I thought back to my WoW days, and remembered I did not enjoy healing(I was not very good at it!), not did I enjoy being right up front in a battle like a tank often is.  So I did a hard pivot and began programming.</p>
<p>It was my relationship with video games and fantasy that helped me make this important life decision.  Every day since it has felt like the right decision.  With my new direction, learning took over and Skyrim fading to the background until I no longer played it.</p>
<p>Next time I returned to video games was for Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) in 2014.  A couple of good friends and I were going to play together.  I was progressing well with my programming studies, and decided it was a right of passage for me to build my own PC.  I was going to build a gaming PC.  I got all the parts, and put it together without any major issues.  I was very proud of myself and used this as a measure of my learning progress in my new path.  So two good friends and I played ESO when it started.  I enjoyed it, but it was different from Skyrim.  You could tell it was Elder Scrolls, but it was very different than a single player experience.  In Skyrim, every class was overpowered, but in an MMO, balance is needed.  Questing together was fun, but not as smooth as we had hoped.  Areas of the map were zoned for different levels, which was both great and took away from an open world feeling.</p>
<p>We played together only for a few months, and then each of us trailed off from playing.  Fast forward to Thanksgiving 2016, and I went out on another black Friday to buy… Skyrim again!  Bought an Xbox One and Skyrim Special Edition (with much faster loading times).  I had a lot of unused vacation time, so was off for most of the month of December.  I pulled my ugly recliner directly in front of the TV; I had plans to be busy.  Since I already knew the game, I dove into the mods that were new to Xbox platform, and even experimented with playing a tank.</p>
<p>In January my father died.  A lot was different after that.  I felt guilty playing video games.  I told myself I <em>should</em> be doing something better with my time.  I <em>should</em> be more productive towards real goals.  Video games don’t accomplish anything, but I would still spend time procrastinating what I was supposed to be doing.  I was trapped in a <em>should</em> cycle; my type A personality raging.</p>
<p>My grief was a wild and transformational experience.  During the journey I felt born anew and simultaneously rediscovered who I authentically am.  I reevaluated everything about myself, my relationships, my possessions, and my life.  I let go of so much I have been holding on to, literally and emotionally.  There is no going back to the way life or I was before.</p>
<p>Fall of the same year, 2017, SNES classic was released.  My husband was kind enough to wait in line in a less desirable area to get one for me.  I dove into playing all the old games I loved and had spent so many hours over the years on.  It never mattered that I had done this before, the simplicity and nostalgia were so pleasant.  I made it a goal to finally beat Zelda: a Link to the Past, and ultimately I did.  Thanks to the help of the internet, which I don’t personally consider cheating, but feel free to debate me on this.  I completed what I had never done before.  I was pleased with myself.</p>
<p>I really enjoy relaxing in the ugly yet oh so comfortable recliner.  I am at least the third person to own it that I know of.  It is suspected to be as old at the original Super Nintendo.  It’s a faded purple upholstery that is somewhere between velour and chenille that is satisfying and comfortable to the touch.  It’s big enough that it could fit 2 times my weight without any issue.  It has a big wooden handle that raises the foot rest with a loud ka-thunk.  It does not plugin.  It is not smooth.  It requires strength to open and then recline.  It’s great for taking naps and for countless hours in front of the TV.</p>
<p>Side note: I now know myself well enough to know that I do not like PC gaming.  I do not want to sit at a desk any longer that I already do for work.  Yes, I am aware that I can get an Xbox controller for a PC, but that’s not what I am looking for.  I find relaxation sitting in that ugly, well-loved, recliner.  This is a personal preference, and I am aware of the trade-offs between console and PC game play.  My main intention to play is to relax, and a little lag is not a big deal to me.	</p>
<p>Early 2018 I found that my mates at work all played video games.  Some played MMORPGS, some MMO Battle Arenas.  There was often conversation of various video games and I began to have passing thoughts about trying ESO on Xbox.  </p>
<p>In March, Sea of Thieves dropped.  Everyone of my mates at work was playing it.  So I watched a trailer.  Seemed pretty simple, a pirate game, where sailing was a big part of the game.  Slow travel.  Beautiful scenery.  Simple mechanics.  So the weekend after it opened, I found myself in an electronics store getting a demo from an Xbox rep.  I made the jump, though I’m not quite sure why it felt like such a jump.  Maybe it was paying for the online service to be able to play with other players.  Maybe it was giving in to video games, when I <em>should</em> be doing something else. Maybe it was the resistance I put up when I am getting close to doing things that could be done to excess.  Either way, I was doing it.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a clue about how to play with others outside of a single game on a console.  There was how to get my mates into my friends list, and then realizing I needed a special headset to get the mic to work.  I ended up playing a few times on the phone because of either parties issues with mics.  I struggled through user interfaces that desperately needed an intuitive user experience.  </p>
<p>So I sailed the seas.  It was simple, but very calming and relaxing.  The mechanics were easy to learn.  It was fun to play coop with people.  Getting to that point, all set up, I kept thinking about ESO.  At the time, the next Elder Scrolls game hadn’t even been confirmed, so it was realistically years away.  So the closet thing I was going to get was ESO.  But I couldn’t pull the trigger, I couldn’t give myself permission.  What finally did was one of my work mates mentioned that they heard there was an update which made ESO really good and they were curious if anyone had played it recently.  That was the moment I gave myself permission.</p>
<p>So I dusted off my old ESO account and created a new character.  The Morrowind expansion had come out the year before, which I bought in addition to the main game.  With Morrowind, your character starts the game in a completely new location with a different storyline that I had played the first time.  This was pretty neat because I was playing the same race, class, and alliance as I did 4 years ago.</p>
<p>My first Elder Scrolls game was Skyrim, but in just about every conversation I have had players have told me how much they loved Morrowind.  So it was pretty great to be playing an expansion in the same location, even if the story and timeline were different.  There were some big characters and houses that were the same though.  Through this I found what might be the  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtZW40vHVf0">theme song</a> to my life, if I could choose one.  I can listen to this for hours on repeat as I code, write or just go about life.</p>
<p>The more I played in Morrowind, the more I got curious about the story.  I researched the history of the Elder Scrolls games, the story line in the original Morrowind, and so many threads started coming together.  I was really enjoying playing, which I did so mostly solo.  While I’m open to playing with others, it’s a bonus, and not something that I need.  These days, I play most nights for an hour or two, and depending on the weekend plans, there as well.  I’m playing enough that I am starting to worry I am hogging the TV from my movie-loving husband 😬.</p>
<p>Since I started playing video games again, I’ve been making great progress in personal projects and creative expression.  I’ve launched a personal website, I dream I’ve had for a decade.  I’ve started a writing practice, which you are reading now.  I’ve started picking up my camera again and shooting.  It’s a contradiction that has really surprised me.  I didn’t notice it at first, and months went by before I reflected and became self-aware of this.  I resisted playing video games because I <em>should</em> be doing better things with my time, but yet in choosing to do less with my time, I have in fact ending up doing more of the things that really matter to me.</p>
<p>I am happier and less judgmental of myself.  I’ve slowed down and consciously do more of what I want to do in the moment than the endless lists of projects and goal that I am driven to achieve.  Looking back, during the time I was playing WoW, I was one of my most creative periods of my life.  I was creating photos regularly.  Crafting my skills.  Hunting, practicing.  I was showing my work in print to people I knew, and was getting great feedback.  It led me to go to learn photography more deeply.</p>
<p>Where I’m at now, video games are an essential part of my productivity.  They help me to really relax so I can rest.  They help me to turn my mind off.  They are an evening or weekend reset that enables me to better focus on what I love and how I want to be spending my time.  So i don’t resist: I lean in.  This brings me joy.  It helps me do more of what I want to be doing, by doing less.</p>
<p>Anything in life is what you make it.  There are so many stories about terrible things that have happened from playing too much video games, but I choose to use this power for good.  I intentionally choose to play, for my benefit.  As a form of therapy, of healing.  When I play, I feel a confidence that I don’t in the real world.  My brain is overstimulated to a point that my negative internal monologue shuts off, and I can just be in the moment.  I don’t doubt and second guess myself.  I tend to overanalyze (or think deeply depending on your point of view) and in video games, there are so many less variables that real life.  This is a relief that my mind craves.  I can either beat that boss solo or I can’t.  It’s not about how do I position this idea, or how much political clout I have, or my ability to express myself, it’s just about what do I want to do now?  Quest, grind, main story line, craft, or hunt for skyshards?  The past doesn’t matter, the future will be what it is, all I have is this present moment.  So I enjoy the journey.</p></div></article></main></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.page={"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-template-js","jsonName":"blog-video-games-31f","path":"/blog/video-games"};window.dataPath="440/path---blog-video-games-31-f-7a2-8uYJJIterimhhRTDU7q6d7Gd0pw";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-fb6570bee9514b514070.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-template-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-template-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-templates-blog-template-js-73a63efad1aef9930e00.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js.919faedb93354433faaf.css","/component---src-pages-404-js-9cdeceaefa714baa56d4.js"],"component---src-pages-about-js":["/component---src-pages-about-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-pages-about-js-fa3b18ba66f314b1b830.js"],"component---src-pages-blog-js":["/component---src-pages-blog-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-pages-blog-js-5099c51f293efb756bcd.js"],"component---src-pages-habits-js":["/component---src-pages-habits-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-pages-habits-js-9183bff465ec1abf6cd3.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-pages-index-js-1ebe0a46024c456bc586.js"],"component---src-pages-now-js":["/component---src-pages-now-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-pages-now-js-2d0d6886ba3371301e71.js"],"component---src-pages-read-js":["/component---src-pages-read-js.cdcb8aaa367d8cd021bf.css","/component---src-pages-read-js-a31c87f5023044589e7e.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/webpack-runtime-4d3a8ca92eb986334e5d.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-fb6570bee9514b514070.js" async=""></script><script src="/0-f4e32d138d4fea20b874.js" async=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-template-js-73a63efad1aef9930e00.js" async=""></script></body></html>
