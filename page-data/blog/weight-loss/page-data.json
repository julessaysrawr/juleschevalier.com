It does not know what the body needs to meet the demands of the day.  It does not know how we feel.  By following something external, we give away our power and ignore our bodies and our intuition.</p>\n<p>Somewhere, we stopped asking ourselves how we feel.  Are you hungry?  Then you should eat.  It is very simple, but there is a lot of cultural programming against this.  We are told that foods are “good” or “bad”, yet food has no moral value.  We are overwhelmed with messaging that values thinness over how we feel.  Why?  Because it preys on our fears and produces huge profits.  We have been convinced that thin equals healthy.

Following rules or restrictions outside of what our body is telling us creates an unhealthy relationship based on the fear of being fat (which plays into the cultural bias that fat is less valued).  Poor body image leading to restriction, restriction leads to feeling deprived, which leads to binging, which then cause bad feelings and poor body image.  It’s a violent cycle that leads many to disordered eating or to eating disorders.  </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/5e8ba/the-dieting-paradox.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"The Dieting Paradox by @zaonutrition\"\n        title=\"The DietingParadox by @zaonutrition on Instagram\"\n        src=\"/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/7a720/the-dieting-paradox.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/b13ee/the-dieting-paradox.jpg 175w,\n/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/032fc/the-dieting-paradox.jpg 350w,\n/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/7a720/the-dieting-paradox.jpg 700w,\n/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/5c1b8/the-dieting-paradox.jpg 1050w,\n/static/710829646cdc7467fc4203dc66cc224f/5e8ba/the-dieting-paradox.jpg 1080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B6vaULylXmd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">Source: Grace Rockwell | Nutritionist</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Living your life in fear of something that may or may not be realistic is to not an intention that I would recommend.</p>\n<p>The idea of a before and after reinforces the withholding of self-love.
