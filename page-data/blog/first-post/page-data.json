If you are reading this, this is a big win for me.  10+ years in the making, and spanning 4 different careers paths.  It started when I wanted to share some photos i was taking with my patients at the oncology clinic I worked in.  I made a physical book.  It was 2006 I think.  When I want to photography school, I made my first website.  I didn’t know how to do any of the things in html or css that I really wanted, like login, or photo galleries.  Turns out those are not done in html/css!!  Long story short, I found myself doing software engineering.  Last year I grieving the lose of a parent, and re-evalutaing everything in my life.  It became clear to be I have everything I need to make the website I really wanted.  I have the knowledge, the skills, and what I don’t know, I am confident I can learn.</p>\n<p>So this.  This has been my dream for so long.  It started when I just wanted to share my photography online (and maybe get some clients).  Over time, I have wanted to create and share with the world.  Thoughts, learnings, book reviews.  Maybe I’ll even find a business along the way.  Who knows where this journey will lead.   I am so pleased and proud to be sharing this with <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading ☺️</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 13, 2018","path":"/blog/first-post","title":"Celebrate the little wins"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
