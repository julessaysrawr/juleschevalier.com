Whether you have many years of experience or you are green from the lack of experience, you will likely encounter this crushing doubt.  It often comes up for me when I am stretching outside my known areas of knowledge or when I am doing something new for the first time.</p>\n<p>Learning is a journey, a progression.  It starts out feeling okay, then starts getting harder, but messily falls apart once you've hit the point where you are struggling, ruling out issues or needing to make decisions you don't fully understand.  </p>\n<p>When you're struggling with learning something new, it's normal to doubt everything from your skills, your job, and even if you're in the right profession.  I used to think that because I had such strong doubts about myself in these moments that something was wrong with me.

The authors Pauline Rose Clance &#x26; Suzanne Imes state that the key differences between men and woman in regards to this concept is that women tend to explain failure with lack of ability, whereas men more often attribute failure to luck or task difficulty.  While the study leaves lots to be desired for nuance and intersectionality, there is something to be said for when the going gets tough, what kinds of narrative do you tell yourself is the reason why?</p>\n<p>But imposter syndrome is not the whole story.  Yes, it might be part of it, or be in a ven diagram of experiences, but there are other factors such as learning new &#x26; complex things can be hard, the Kübler-Ross Model, and the Dunning-Kruger Effect.

Her model included five stages: Denial, Anger, Bargaing, Depression and Acceptance. It has been commonly expanded to also include Shock and Integration.</p>\n<p>The connection to building software is that we go through this process when we face a hard problem we haven't encountered before. The Kübler-Ross change curve applies to any significant loss or change. Every time we stretch our skills outside what we already know and are comfortable with, we have to face that we don't know as much as we think we do, that we might have been overconfident, and perhaps we have underestimated others who can do this. Seeing ourselves or our skills differently can be jarring.</p>\n<p>\n  <a class='gatsby-resp-image-link' href='/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/e3a8a/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg' style='display: block' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>\n  \n  <span class='gatsby-resp-image-wrapper' style='position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n    <span class='gatsby-resp-image-background-image' style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHWoqRYiV//xAAZEAEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIREiH/2gAIAQEAAQUCGWMfLaHbf//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABgQAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABETEQ/9oACAEBAAY/AlM5NNf/xAAaEAEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABACExERBx/9oACAEBAAE/IXrrtTqcb8gaEaEMlkY+L//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQ7A//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPxCH/8QAGxABAAMAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBYfH/2gAIAQEAAT8QMrZUG8532EaW+1Ro1e3HxKzAgoUHcfiJ/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class='gatsby-resp-image-image' style='width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;' alt='alt' title='' src='/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/046a4/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg' srcset='/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/843e4/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 175w,\n/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/72334/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 350w,\n/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/046a4/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 700w,\n/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/e3a8a/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 768w' sizes='(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px'>\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>When you're in the bottom of the depression stage, it's normal to doubt everything from your skills, your job, and even if you're in the right profession.

Her model included five stages: Denial, Anger, Bargaing, Depression and Acceptance. It has been commonly expanded to also include Shock and Integration.</p>\n<p>The connection to building software is that we go through this process when we face a hard problem we haven't encountered before. The Kübler-Ross change curve applies to any significant loss or change. Every time we stretch our skills outside what we already know and are comfortable with, we have to face that we don't know as much as we think we do, that we might have been overconfident, and perhaps we have underestimated others who can do this. Seeing ourselves or our skills differently can be jarring.</p>\n<p>\n  <a class='gatsby-resp-image-link' href='/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/e3a8a/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg' style='display: block' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>\n  \n  <span class='gatsby-resp-image-wrapper' style='position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n    <span class='gatsby-resp-image-background-image' style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class='gatsby-resp-image-image' style='width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;' alt='alt' title='' src='/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/046a4/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg' srcset='/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/843e4/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 175w,\n/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/72334/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 350w,\n/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/046a4/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 700w,\n/static/7e1a3f4840dc6cc1510ab1fcfe01819b/e3a8a/Kubler-Ross-Change-Curve.jpg 768w' sizes='(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px'>\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>When you're in the bottom of the depression stage, it's normal to doubt everything from your skills, your job, and even if you're in the right profession. Just because you think a thought doesn't make it true. Thoughts are not facts. Neither are emotions. When you're in this stage, recognize it is temporary, give yourself grace, and be gentle with yourself.</p>\n<p>The goal is to not give up when you are in the valley of despair, but to keep going knowing that you can figure it out. Maybe you need to ask for help, maybe you need to step away and think about something else for a while. Maybe you need to look at the problem from a different angle. Maybe you are missing some key piece of information. If you keep going, on painful step at a time, you will prevail, learn new things, and be a more competent technologist for it.</p>\n<p>Next steps: <br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remind yourself that feelings are temporary</li>\n<li>Keep learning and practicing</li>\n<li>Ask other people how you're doing</li>\n<li>Challenge negative beliefs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further reading: <br />\nTo me, there seems to be a lot of overlap between the Kübler-Ross model and the <a href=\"hhttps://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>.
