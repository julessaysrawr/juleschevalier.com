My body doesn't process grains well, so this is a recipe that feels special and I use regularly.  </p>\n<p>If you're paying attention to FODMAPs, just use a banana before it goes ripe (minimal brown spots).  This will still work is a slight green banana.</p>\n<p>I usually put a slice of butter on top.  If I am feeling extra special, I'll put maple syrup on as well.  Though is it sweet enough just as it is for my palate.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 3rd, 2020","path":"/articles/banana-pancakes","title":"Banana Pancakes","topic":"Recipes"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
