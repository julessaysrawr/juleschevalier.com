It says to women, trans and non-binary people that they are second and not important enough to be included in a greeting.  It perpetuates the patriarchy and is also transphobic.  Imagine saying “Hey Guys” to a group that included a trans woman; that would be a micro-aggression.  This begs the question, why does gender need to be a part of a greeting in the first place?</p>\n<p>So much of our language centers on gender, which is assumed to be cisgender.  Cisgender is when your gender identity matches what was assigned at birth by doctors.  Transgender is when you gender does not match what was assigned at birth.  Often we use language unconsciously, like muscle memory.  It can be difficult to change phrasing that is instinctual.  It's not your fault if you didn't know, but consider this your education on the subject and a challenge to do better going forward.  We should all be intentional about our language, because we do not want to cause harm to others.</p>\n<h2>Ways to greet a group of people</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Hey y’all / you all</h4>\n<p>People not from the south-eastern states have my full permission to get over their issue with this.  This is the <em>best</em> gender inclusive greeting that rolls off the tongue.
