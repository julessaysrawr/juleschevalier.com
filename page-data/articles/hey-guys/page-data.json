It says to women and trans people that they are second to men and not important enough to include in a greeting.  It perpetuates the patriarchy and is also transphobic.  Imagine saying “hey guys” to a group that included a trans woman, that would be a micro-aggression.</p>\n<p>So much of our language centers on gender, which is assumed to be cisgender.  Why does gender need to be a part of a greeting?  Why does gender need to be included in statements that it is not related to: when we say “you’re such a good boy/girl” what does gender have to do with it?  Why not “that was a great job”.
