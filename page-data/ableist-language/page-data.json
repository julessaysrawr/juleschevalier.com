If you say <strong>\"crazy\", \"insane\", \"crippled\", \"blind spot\"</strong> or <strong>\"tone deaf\"</strong> that's ableist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ableism</a> is discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities or who are perceived with disabilities. Ableism implies that people with disabilities are inferior to those who do not have disabilities, or have less value to offer society. People with disabilities make up <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">25% of the U.S. population</a>. You probably know several people with who have a disability, even if you might not be aware of it.</p>\n<p>Words have power, especially if they are said repeatedly. Casually using words like those listed below can be hurtful, othering, or a painful reminder of how society views them as something that is considered bad or non-desireable.</p>\n<p>As I started shifting away from the phrase <a href=\"/inclusive-ways-to-say-hey-guys\">\"Hey Guys\"</a>, I observed myself saying phrases that are harmful to people with disabilities or mental illnesses. While changing word choices does take some practice, the effort is more than worth it if you can avoid hurting someone or perpetuating discrimination.</p>\n<h4>Here are some common ableist words and what to say instead:</h4>\n<p><strong>Crazy</strong> => <em>unbelievable, outrageous, confusing, unpredictable, doesn't make sense</em></p>\n<p><strong>Insane</strong> => <em>unreal, reckless, out of control</em></p>\n<p><strong>OCD</strong> => <em>meticulous, anal retentive, hyper-focused</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -24px;\">Only use OCD to describe someone with actual OCD</p>\n<p><strong>Dumb</strong> => <em>uninformed, bad</em></p>\n<p><strong>Stupid</strong> => <em>awful, not thinking clearly</em></p>\n<p><strong>Retarded</strong> => <em>ridiculous</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lame</strong> => <em>boring, uninteresting, uncool, monotonous</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crippled</strong> => <em>frozen by, completely stuck</em></p>\n<p><strong>Blind / Blind Spot / Blinders</strong> => <em>shortcoming, deficiency, failure, defect, ignorant about</em></p>\n<p><strong>Deaf</strong> => <em>insensitive, oblivious, ignorant about</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tone Deaf</strong> => <em>tackless, out of touch, out of context, read the room, willfully ignorant about</em></p>\n<p><strong>Disabled Person</strong> => <em>Person with a disability</em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -24px;\">They are people first and they have a disability.  Their disability is not their entire identity.  They are children, siblings, parents, spouses, successful and many more identities.  Donâ€™t make their disability the most important thing about someone. </p>\n<br />\n<p>What other words would you add to this list?</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 19th, 2020","path":"/ableist-language","title":"Ableist Language And What You Can Say Instead","summary":"To be more inclusive of people with disabilities, stop saying these words","topic":"Inclusion","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5034965034965035,"src":"/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/52efb/IMG_1217.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/f5236/IMG_1217.jpg 215w,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/9865e/IMG_1217.jpg 430w,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/52efb/IMG_1217.jpg 860w,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/1ff5b/IMG_1217.jpg 1290w,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/96dc6/IMG_1217.jpg 1720w,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/7700f/IMG_1217.jpg 6240w","sizes":"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"}}}}},"SocialImage":{"frontmatter":{"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":1200,"height":630,"src":"/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/0eab3/IMG_1217.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/0eab3/IMG_1217.jpg 1x,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/b04b1/IMG_1217.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/b1d2cfe0aaced214572bfeb4b7d3dde8/b5cc9/IMG_1217.jpg 2x"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
