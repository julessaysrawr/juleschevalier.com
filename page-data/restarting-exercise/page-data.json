It is not a reflection on you or your worth.  To be able to move forward, here are some ideas to help set you up for success:</p>\n<h4 id=\"rest\" style=\"position:relative;\">Rest<a href=\"#rest\" aria-label=\"rest permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Really give yourself permission to rest.  If things have gone down, you  probably need to recover.  Also, since you are going to be moving and stressing your body, set it up for success by being well-rested when you start.</p>\n<h4 id=\"practice-time-for-yourself\" style=\"position:relative;\">Practice time for yourself<a href=\"#practice-time-for-yourself\" aria-label=\"practice time for yourself permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Part of restarting a movement habit is just restarting self care.  Movement is self-care: for mind, body and spirit.  Start by taking some extra time for yourself.  Take a few minutes to mindfully put some lotion on, do a face mask, journal or whatever is your favorite flavor of self-care.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stretch\" style=\"position:relative;\">Stretch<a href=\"#stretch\" aria-label=\"stretch permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>If you have had to take a break from movement, your body is probably tight and holding onto something.  Make time to just casually stretch and move within your body without any exceptions or outcomes in mind.  Be present and do what feels good.</p>\n<h4 id=\"orgasm\" style=\"position:relative;\">Orgasm<a href=\"#orgasm\" aria-label=\"orgasm permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>Solo or with a partner.  If you’ve been stressed, set that aside and let yourself come back into your body.  Orgasms can be a great way to relax and recover when things are out of balance.  If you have had to set aside movement, it means things have gotten out of balance for a while and this reset is about being kind to yourself and bringing things back into balance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"set-low-low-low-expectations\" style=\"position:relative;\">Set low, low, low expectations<a href=\"#set-low-low-low-expectations\" aria-label=\"set low low low expectations permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>It’s about starting small and setting yourself up for success.  It doesn’t matter how many pushups you were doing before.  Let go of the expectation that you will pick back up from where you left off.  Set a goal so low it’s almost laughable.  For example: if you have been doing 50 reps of an exercise before, set a goal to do 5.  Even simpler, you can use the <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">two minute rule</a> to get started.  The idea is to set your goal so small that it is easily achievable and that there is not a mental barrier to get started.  If you are able to succeed with the starter goal: great.  If you feel like you can do more: amazing.  Listen to your body and love yourself along the way.  You deserve to be loved and accepted.  Especially by you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Doing anything is better than doing nothing at all</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"its-about-progress-not-perfection\" style=\"position:relative;\">It’s about progress, not perfection<a href=\"#its-about-progress-not-perfection\" aria-label=\"its about progress not perfection permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>It’s about putting in time and effort, not meeting a target.  Sure, more reps or more weight is nice, but those will come naturally as you are getting back into your movement routine.  Doing anything is better than doing nothing at all, so focus on doing something.  It is better to do something simple and enjoy it that doing an intensive or exhausting activity.  Once you get a small step forward, it is that much easier to do it again, and you can very quickly feel the momentum build.</p>\n<h4 id=\"celebrate\" style=\"position:relative;\">Celebrate<a href=\"#celebrate\" aria-label=\"celebrate permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>I mean it.  Celebrate the <em>tinyiest</em> of achievements.  Tell yourself “Good job, I’m really proud of you for doing that today.  That is a step forward from yesterday”.  Celebrate giving yourself permission to rest.  Celebrate taking time for yourself.  Celebrate stretching.  Celebrate any moments of being present and conscious with yourself.  Celebrate moments of self-care.  Many of us were not taught how to care for ourselves.  It can be a revolutionary act to love and care for yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\">Final thoughts<a href=\"#final-thoughts\" aria-label=\"final thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>You will have setbacks.  Plan for them - know how you are going to pick yourself and continue.  Ups and downs are part of the process.  The trick is to give yourself grace and kindness while moving through them.</p>\n<p>Once you are able to build a little momentum, keep it small and light.  Keep your expectations on the practice, not on the outcomes.  It’s about flow, not winning.  When people use the expression “I’ve fallen off the wagon” it makes me think that they were traveling along at a pace and something has caused them to stop.  It doesn’t have to be all or nothing: there is more options than stopped or full wagon speed.  Life is always happening.  We have to adapt and adjust as circumstances dictate.  They better you can start again, the more resilient you will become.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 23rd, 2020","path":"/restarting-exercise","title":"Restarting An Exercise Routine","topic":"Intentional Living","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5034965034965035,"src":"/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/52efb/IMG_2433.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/f5236/IMG_2433.jpg 215w,\n/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/9865e/IMG_2433.jpg 430w,\n/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/52efb/IMG_2433.jpg 860w,\n/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/1ff5b/IMG_2433.jpg 1290w,\n/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/96dc6/IMG_2433.jpg 1720w,\n/static/7889b74c643e9f1fa49057d02820e36a/4b78d/IMG_2433.jpg 3811w","sizes":"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
