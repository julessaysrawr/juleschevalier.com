When you hear a concern or a compliant, is your first instinct is to spring to action or suggestions?  Do you sometimes mentally jump before the other person is done talking?

Learning to be a caring listener and a skilled questioner can go a long way toward empowering others to find their own solutions. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-dance-connection/201902/you-give-advice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Harriet Lerner Ph.D. - Before You Give Advice</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Reflection Prompt: Why do you give advice?</h4>\n<p>If you answered to help people, <em>go deeper</em>, and ask yourself if they are asking for help before you give it?  If you are giving advice without request, it is unsolicited advice.  </p>\n<p>So <em>why</em> you are giving unsolicited advice?  Some possibilities might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wanting to be in control or right</li>\n<li>emotional validation</li>\n<li>the need for personal power</li>\n<li>it’s easier to change others than change ourselves</li>\n<li>your own emotional discomfort</li>\n<li>lack of your own boundaries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my own experience, if I am giving advice, there is an underlying false sense that I know what is “right” is or at least what is “better”; that I am in some way superior or have superior insight.  In reality, we are all equals and have different paths in life.  I have come to learn that the people who explicitly tell me they are <em>not looking for advice</em> are my teachers because they understand their own boundaries.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2901d510a097442a73dcb45c05f9d463/441c5/lisaoliveratherapy.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Lisa Olivera, a therapist on Instagram, said it best: “Assuming it’s your job to fix people, says a lot more about your needs than theirs.”\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2901d510a097442a73dcb45c05f9d463/441c5/lisaoliveratherapy.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2901d510a097442a73dcb45c05f9d463/843e4/lisaoliveratherapy.jpg 175w,\n/static/2901d510a097442a73dcb45c05f9d463/72334/lisaoliveratherapy.jpg 350w,\n/static/2901d510a097442a73dcb45c05f9d463/441c5/lisaoliveratherapy.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B8hN8r5AMUz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Lisa Olivera, a therapist on Instagram: “Thinking we should fix, change, or heal anyone outside of ourselves is a great distraction from doing our own inner work.”</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-fixing-communicates\" style=\"position:relative;\">What “Fixing” Communicates<a href=\"#what-fixing-communicates\" aria-label=\"what fixing communicates permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>I’ve seen the idea of <code>#notlookingforadvice</code> float around.
