Binary thinking doesn’t leave room for nuance. There are more options than A and B.  There is also C, D, E, and so on.  When you declare for yourself who you are, not what others have assigned to you, that is when magic happens. I had to make space to be myself in a way that didn’t exist before - both inside myself and out in the world.</p>\n<p>Within us all exist multitudes. Agnes Chew explains that we are “a living microcosm of the entire emotional spectrum of oxymoronic paradoxes within a single moment that could never be logically construed”.</p>\n<p>For me, being non-binary (and having known that long before the word was introduced into the lexicon) means more than not being confined to one of two gender boxes. It means permission to define what <em>my gender</em> is. How it is dynamic. For me, it’s both/and (masculine and feminine) not either/or.</p>\n<p>There have always been people like me; across time, across cultures. Even when it’s uncomfortable for others, standing in my truth connects me with the great tradition of queer resistance. I’m grateful for the work and sacrifices of so many who came before me, especially trans women of color, who paved the way for me to be able to live openly. My enby siblings and I stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>\n<p>As recently as five years ago, if you had told me I would be out at work and expressing my gender authentically - I would not have believed that possible. I am humbled and grateful for MassMutual’s efforts to have an inclusive culture - it makes all the difference to me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-you-can-support-non-binary-folks\" style=\"position:relative;\">How You Can Support Non-binary Folks:<a href=\"#how-you-can-support-non-binary-folks\" aria-label=\"how you can support non binary folks permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Use inclusive language</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I feel seen when people avoid “hey guys” and use “folks” or “everyone” instead.</li>\n<li>Decenter gender when referring to a group of people, and use “everyone”, “people” or “team”.
