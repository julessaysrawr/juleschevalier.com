While that was true for reasons that little me did not yet understand, it was also internal misogyny.</p>\n<p>I went out of my way to not fall into stereotypes of what it meant to be a woman.  As a 8-year-old, I remember watching the move <em>The Gods Must Be Crazy II</em> and vowing to myself I would never be as weak or as helpless as the female lead.  I promised myself I would learn skills that would make me a survivor.  Her story would not be my future.</p>\n<p>There are too many strengths, interests, expressions, styles and attitudes to say \"this is what it means to be a woman/man/person\".  The individual gets to decide what it means for them.  Some like to be taken care of, other like to be care givers.  Some want to leave a mark, others are content with a simple life.  Let's separate traits from gender, as there is no right way to meet others expectations.  The best thing to do is just be authentically yourself.</p>\n<p>What I would go back and tell my 8-year-old self is that gender has nothing to with your character.  Also - there are more than two genders!  Character traits are something you may have control over, but do not attach generalizations or harmful stereotypes of gender to specific traits.  I have crossed paths with more strong women than weak and more empathetic men than aggressive.</p>\n<p>Femme does not mean weak. <br/>\nMasc does not mean strong. <br/>\nStrong is strong.</p>\n<p>There is no one or right way to be a man, woman or person.  You choose how you want to create yourself.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 31st, 2020","path":"/no-right-way-to-be-a-person","title":"There Is No Right Way To Be A Man, Woman or Person","topic":"Inclusion","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3354037267080745,"src":"/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/52efb/IMG_5771.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/f5236/IMG_5771.jpg 215w,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/9865e/IMG_5771.jpg 430w,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/52efb/IMG_5771.jpg 860w,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/1ff5b/IMG_5771.jpg 1290w,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/96dc6/IMG_5771.jpg 1720w,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/1578e/IMG_5771.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"}}}}},"SocialImage":{"frontmatter":{"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":1200,"height":630,"src":"/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/b1395/IMG_5771.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/b1395/IMG_5771.jpg 1x,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/1b461/IMG_5771.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/e378c188e3bee18551da0bff00c0a473/0e1f8/IMG_5771.jpg 2x"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
