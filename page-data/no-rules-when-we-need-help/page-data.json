You have to meet yourself where you are and do things outside the box. If the goal is to get to the finish line, maybe you usually take one path to get there, but there is nothing wrong with taking a shortcut when you need it the most. You owe it to yourself not to do everything on hard mode. This is especially true if you are neurodivergent.</p>\n<p>If you’re struggling to tackle an overflowing amount of dishes that you have been procrastinating for days: normal rules do not apply. Load the dishwasher just as they are, without rising and scrubbing. Run it just like that. If the dishes aren’t clean, run again. There is no rule that says you can’t just run the machine twice, or even thrice. When you’re struggling with something, it’s okay to ask for assistance or make it easier on yourself. </p>\n<p>If you’re finding it hard to feed yourself, eat your version of lunchables for dinner.</p>\n<p>If you need more recovery time because something didn’t go as expected: cancel plans, reschedule them or even call out from work. There is nothing wrong if you just need a reset.</p>\n<p>There are so many pressures on us and many expectations were programmed into us when we were children. When you’re faced with something that seems too hard to do, ask yourself “What is the least effort way I could get the same end result?”</p>\n<p>We are human beings, not human doings. It’s important for us to take the time we need to step out of expectations and narratives so that we can step back into ourselves.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 31st, 2021","path":"/no-rules-when-we-need-help","title":"There are no rules when we need help","topic":"Emotional Wellbeing","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5034965034965035,"src":"/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/52efb/DSC3706.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/f5236/DSC3706.jpg 215w,\n/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/9865e/DSC3706.jpg 430w,\n/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/52efb/DSC3706.jpg 860w,\n/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/1ff5b/DSC3706.jpg 1290w,\n/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/96dc6/DSC3706.jpg 1720w,\n/static/cb95d2beea76ab5ddc50504faebf4dfe/f28e1/DSC3706.jpg 3008w","sizes":"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
