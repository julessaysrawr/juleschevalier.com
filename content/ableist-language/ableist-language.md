Words have power.  For marginalized groups, which include people who live with mental and physical impairments, using common language can be hurtful, harmful and a painful reminder of how they are excluded or treated differently.  Casually using words like these can invalidate them or belittle their experience.

As I started shifting away from the phrase ["Hey Guys"](/inclusive-ways-to-say-hey-guys), I observed myself saying phrases that are harmful to people with disabilities or mental illnesses.  While changing word choices does take some practice, the effort is more than worth it if you can avoid hurting someone or perpetuating discrimination.

#### Here are some common ableist words and what to say instead:

**Crazy** => *unbelievable, outrageous, confusing, unpredictable*

**Insane** => *unreal, reckless, out of control*

**OCD** => *meticulous, anal retentive, hyper-focused*
<p style="margin-top: -24px;">Only use OCD to describe someone with actual OCD</p>

**Dumb** => *uninformed, bad*

**Stupid** => *awful*

**Retarded** => *ridiculous*

**Lame** => *boring, uninteresting, uncool, monotonous*

**Crippled** => *frozen by, completely stuck*

**Blind / Blind Spot / Blinders** => *shortcoming, deficiency, failure, defect, ignorant about*

**Deaf** => *insensitive, oblivious, ignorant about*

**Tone Deaf** => *tackless, out of touch, out of context, read the room, willfully ignorant about*


**Disabled Person** => *Person with a disability*
<p style="margin-top: -24px;">They are people first and they have a disability.  Their disability is not their entire identity.  They are children, siblings, parents, spouses, successful and many more identities.  Donâ€™t make their disability the most important thing about someone. </p>
