What is true north?

Success is not the destination.

Because what comes after? Once you are successful will you be happy?

If success is a pit stop on the way to happiness, why not have that now? Everyone is able to achieve that now, privilege is not required.

Gratitude. Start with where you are. The room you are in, what your day looks like, who you share your life with, the many advantages you have already. You might be surprized what take for granted. Things a past version of yourself wished for.

When you can truly see what you already have, you will realize you already have enough. And that my friend, is happiness.
