This has been such a joy to discover.

I was craving a dip that was kinds like a French onion sour cream dip, but maybe more like the texture of ranch. I needed it to be non-dairy and FODMAP free, which is tricky: garlic and onion are in a lot of dressings.

When making this, I don't usually measure: I just taste and adjust. Here are the started ratios.

## Ingredients

- [Primal Kitchen Mayo](https://www.primalkitchen.com/collections/mayo/products/avocado-oil-mayo?variant=4631981948957) 40g
- Lemon juice or [Coconut Vinegar](https://coconutsecret.com/pages/coconut-vinegar)10g
  - If you want to substitute apple cider vinegar, you will need to likely add more as that is not as concentrated
- [Fody Garlic Infused Olive Oil](https://www.fodyfoods.com/collections/kitchen-staples/products/low-fodmap-garlic-infused-olive-oil) 10g
- Dill
- Kosher salt
- Pepper
- Water (to thin, if desired)

This dressing is great for:

- Dipping: carrots, veggies, chips
- Salad dressing; I usually thin it a little
- Mayo replacement/flavor up
- Burgers (especially turkey)

#### Where to buy:

**Mayo** - I can find the mayo in natural foods stores and now even in my regular chain grocery store.

**Coconut Vinegar** - I can usually find this at a natural foods store

**Garlic Infused Olive Oil** - I have not found this in any store, though I do see more products from this great brand in both natural and regular grocery stores. I buy this on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DNG9WVL/ref=twister_B07FDJZ291?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1).
