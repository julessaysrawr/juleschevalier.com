As a child socialized as female, I would distance myself from other girls. “I’m not like them” I would think. While that was true for reasons that little me did not yet understand, it was also internal misogyny.

I went out of my way to not fall into stereotypes of what it meant to be a woman. As a 8-year-old, I remember watching the move _The Gods Must Be Crazy II_ and vowing to myself I would never be as weak or as helpless as the female lead. I promised myself I would learn skills that would make me a survivor. Her story would not be my future.

There are too many strengths, interests, expressions, styles and attitudes to say "this is what it means to be a woman/man/person". The individual gets to decide what it means for them. Some like to be taken care of, other like to be care givers. Some want to leave a mark, others are content with a simple life. Let's separate traits from gender, as there is no right way to meet others expectations. The best thing to do is just be authentically yourself.

What I would go back and tell my 8-year-old self is that gender has nothing to with your character. Also - there are more than two genders! Character traits are something you may have control over, but do not attach generalizations or harmful stereotypes of gender to specific traits. I have crossed paths with more strong women than weak and more empathetic men than aggressive.

Femme does not mean weak. <br/>
Masc does not mean strong. <br/>
Strong is strong.

There is no one or right way to be a man, woman or person. You choose how you want to create yourself.
