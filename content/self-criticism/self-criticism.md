My greatest fear is that I am not good enough.  It’s a pretty common fear and for me, it is an [Automatic Negative Thought](https://www.collaborativeawareness.com/post/2015/12/18/9-types-of-ants-automatic-negative-thoughts-that-invade-our-relationships-and-how-to-exte) when certain types of conflict arise.  I blame myself, making myself feel small and unworthy.

I have spent years trying to improve my self-esteem and even though there has been great progress, when something bad happens, I still revert right back to thinking it’s my fault and I am not "good enough" when encountering certain types of situations.  It often comes up when I have unmet needs.

Recently I discovered a reflection activity that has proven priceless to unpacking these emotionally charged and familiar thought patterns.  

To do the activity you need a piece of paper and a pencil or pen.  
- You name the negative thought at the top.  
- Then draw two columns leaving some room at the bottom of the page
  - The left column is called "Evidence For"
  - The right column is called "Evidence Against"
  - In these columns, write out all of the evidence for and against this negative thought. 
- At the bottom of the page, you can then reframe the thought in a more loving way, integrate compassion and acceptance into your understanding of what happened.  

You can download the [printable template](https://juleschevalier.com/Challenging-Critical-Thoughts.pdf) I use.

I’d love any feedback you have on this; if it works for you or if you use another type of activity to work through these types of emotions.
