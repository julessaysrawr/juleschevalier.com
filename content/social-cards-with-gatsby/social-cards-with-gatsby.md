As I've been sharing links more often from my website, I noticed that when I would share a link over text or slack that the social card could be improved.

## Starting point

<br />

Observations

- The image is the same default site image every time I share an article, even though each article has a custom image
- The titles of the articles don't show - only the site title
- The description displayed is the one for the site, I'd like to have it display a summary of each article instead

## Approach

I'm going to tackle this piece by piece. First I did some research to understand what is ahead so I can make a plan.  Here are the options I found:

### Option 1: No custom photos, but programmatically generated text to image

[gatsby-remark-social-cards](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-social-cards/)

There's a also good series from Learn with Jason [Part 1](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/design-social-sharing-card/) and [Part 2](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/auto-generate-social-image/) and the resulting npm package [get-share-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jlengstorf/get-share-image)

### Option 2: Custom photo, with custom overlay area with text

[gatsby-plugin-social-cards](<[https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-social-cards/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-social-cards/)>)

### Option 3: Custom photos with no text overlay

[Custom image with default fallback](https://juliangaramendy.dev/blog/custom-open-graph-images-in-gatsby-blog)

## Selection

I opted to go with option 3 because it was most important to me to have the unique article image (that I photographed!) display with each link. I didn't want text to overlay the image, but I did want the article title and description to display.

## Implementation

### 1. Add a prop to the layout component to take in the frontmatter for the article image.

I already had the image in the frontmatter

```
featuredImage: "IMG_1234.jpg"
```

I added this to my `articleTemplate.js` file and pass `image` as a prop into my layout component.

```
//articleTemplate.js

const { featuredImage } = frontmatter
const ogImagePath = featuredImage && featuredImage.childImageSharp.fixed.src

...

return (
  <LayoutMain title={`${frontmatter.title} | By Jules Chevalier`} image={ogImagePath}>
  ...
  </LayoutMain>
)

```

I already was using the site thumbnail as the image for the social card, so I added the new image from props and if that doesn't exist, it will default back to the site image.

```
// layout-main.js
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content={
    props.image
      ? `https://juleschevalier.com${props.image}`
      : data.site.siteMetadata.thumbnail
  }
/>

<meta
  name="twitter:image"
  content={
    props.image
      ? `https://juleschevalier.com${props.image}`
      : data.site.siteMetadata.thumbnail
  }
/>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note the reason for not using just `props.image` is that is only a partial path from the root url. You need to add your domain name for the image to be reachable.

### 2. Crop the article images with different aspect ratio

I realized that the images were not the right size, so they weren't showing up in the validators. According to [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/)

> [The image] should be at least 600√ó315 pixels, but 1200√ó630 or larger is preferred (up to 5MB). Stay close to a 1.91:1 aspect ratio to avoid cropping.

I was using the same image for the article photo, but that had a different aspect ratio (1.5).

I was able to add a new query in `articleTemplate.js` for the social image, cropping to 1200 x 630. I used a fixed query for this. Next, I noticed the crops of the images were not in the center, which I didn't like. Looking into gatsby image query params, I noticed it uses `gatsby-plugin-sharp` which has `cropFocus` and `fit` as options.

```
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query($path: String!) {
    BlogPostByPath: markdownRemark(frontmatter: { path: { eq: $path } }) {
      html
      frontmatter {
        date(formatString: "MMMM Do, YYYY")
        path
        title
        topic
        featuredImage {
          childImageSharp {
            fluid(maxWidth: 860, quality: 75) {
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    SocialImage: markdownRemark(frontmatter: { path: { eq: $path } }) {
      frontmatter {
        featuredImage {
          childImageSharp {
            fixed(width: 1200, height: 630, cropFocus: CENTER, quality: 50) {
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFixed
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

### 3. Update the card title to the article title

Since the title of the article was already getting passed to the layout component for the page title, I just had to add the option for the social cards

```
// layout-main.js
<meta property="og:title" content={props.title || data.site.siteMetadata.title} />
...
<meta name="twitter:title" content={props.title || data.site.siteMetadata.title} />
```

### 4. Descriptions

Next, I wanted to have a short description or summary of each post that I could use for the cards that display it. Twitter, Facebook and search use this. LinkedIn and iMessage does not.

I started by adding a new field to frontmatter called `summary` and added that to each article. It seems for SEO the [character max is 160](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description).

```
// articleTemplate.js
<Layout
  ...
  description={frontmatter.summary}
>
```

Then I added it to both the open graph and twitter descriptions. It was already an option for the page description, but I am showing that also for consistency sake.

```

// layout-main.js
<meta
  name="description"
  content={props.description || data.site.siteMetadata.description}
/>

<meta
  property="og:description"
  content={props.description || data.site.siteMetadata.description}
/>

<meta
  name="twitter:description"
  content={props.description || data.site.siteMetadata.description}
/>
```

## Testing

To test on localhost, I found a lot of mentions to use `ngrok` which I have found super useful in the past. I couldn't get any of the validators to successfully load the cards though (even though the links were working).

So of course I pushed to production üôà to test. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

### Sites I used for testing:

- [iframely](http://debug.iframely.com)
- [twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
- [facebook sharing debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
- [linkedin post inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)

‚ö†Ô∏è you need an account and to be logged in for these to work (except iframely)

I had trouble with LinkedIn showing the updates, apparently they cache previews for 7 days.

## Result

![Result of completed feature](./result.png)

Now each time I share an article, the image is what a reader will see when they click the link. Additionally the card has a correct title and description, so they have a sense of what the link will show them.
