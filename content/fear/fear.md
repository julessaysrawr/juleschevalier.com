### What helps me when I am afraid:

> I must not fear.
>
> Fear is the mind-killer.
>
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
>
> I will face my fear.
>
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
>
> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
>
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

_Frank Herbert, author of the Dune Series_
