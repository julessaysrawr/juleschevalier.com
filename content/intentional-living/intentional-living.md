## What does intentional living mean to me?

Being present in the moment, and practices to shift your awareness back to your body and the now

Daily practice that align with your values

Feeding yourself foods that nourish you: body, mind, and spirit

Prioritizing rest

Managing stress, and knowing what you need to do when you get lost in it

Creating value for others, to the best of my ability without causing harm to myself

An ever improving relationship with myself, including reframing negative self-talk

Meeting others where they are

Consuming with purpose, not impulse

Financially living within my means, preparing for the future, and not depriving myself now

## What does Intentional Living look like in practice?

Creating systems that support the elimination of as many decisions that make sense.

For me, this looks like:

- Creating a uniform and using a capsule wardrobe
- Have a menu of easy to prepare meals and always have those ingredients in the house
- Creating go-to meals that you can prep in bulk and eat throughout the week
- Clearly defined procedures for how to manage stress (and some that can be done anywhere or in a crisis)
- Adding potential items for purchase to a curation list, and contemplating what value they bring before purchase
