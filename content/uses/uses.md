## Work

### Standing desk 
This manual hand-crank sit/stand [desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skarsta-desk-sit-stand-white-s89324812/) works well.  When I bought it I didnâ€™t want to spend the money for an electric motor, which I majorly regret.  I am now thinking about getting this [SmartDesk](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business?option1=1&option2=6&option16=38&option17=41).

### Chair 
Really great comfortable and stylish [chair](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alefjaell-office-chair-grann-golden-brown-70419985/).  Great leather quality.

### Light Therapy Lamp
[Full spectrum light](https://www.verilux.com/collections/happylight-therapy-lamps-boxes/products/happylight-lumi) makes such a difference for me in winter and on rainy days.  It improves my mood and gives me energy.


### Computer
I use a 15-inch MacBook Pro for both work and personal devices.

### Keyboard and Mouse
Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2.

### Monitor
I use an old Apple 27-inch Cinema Display.  I use a dongle chain to get it to work with the usb-c ports on my MacBooks.

### Monitor Stand
This nice [wooden block](https://www.etsy.com/listing/113504434/the-last-stand-for-thunderbolt-imac-and?ref=yr_purchases) stand perfectly matches the monitor foot.

### Headphones
AirPods Pro

## Photography
### Camera
[Canon 6D Mark II EOS](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1346734-REG/canon_eos_6d_mark_ii.html). Full frame is important to me.

### Tripod
Just got the [Peak Design Travel Tripod](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/travel-tripod).  Also have an old Manfrotto tripod that is still going strong.

### Camera Bag
[Peak Design Everyday Backpack](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack?variant=29743300837420).  20L
