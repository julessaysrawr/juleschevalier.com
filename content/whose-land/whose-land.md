I purchased the land my home sits on, but but two hundred years before our home was built, this land was not for sale. This land was not stolen, but conquered from the people that lived here: the [Nipmuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipmuc), [Pocumtuc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocomtuc) and [Agawam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agawam_people) peoples. The settlers, immigrants and colonizers fought, killed and spread small pox to the original inhabitants of this land.

Before the first Europeans came to Plymouth Massachusetts, there was Christopher Columbus. While he never set foot in North America, he gets credited for “discovering” America. There is a US federal holiday that celebrates his legacy.

Yet Christopher Columbus didn’t discover anything - there were countless Indigenous peoples already here. He enslaved thousands of people. He kidnapped and raped women and children. His cruelty was so bad he was brought back to Spain in chains and stripped of his royal titles.

> Columbus Day celebrates and glorifies the violence of Columbus and colonialism. It needs to be abolished.

I recognize that Indigenous people where the first inhabitants of the Americans and therefore choose to honor Indigenous Peoples Day on the second Monday in October.

History does not start with the footprints of white men. The land I live on was stolen from the Nipmuck, Pocumtuc and Agawans peoples.
