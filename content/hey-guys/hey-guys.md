The greeting "Hey Guys" assumes male is the default gender. It says to women, trans and non-binary people that they are second and not important enough to be included in a greeting. It perpetuates the patriarchy and is also transphobic. Imagine saying “Hey Guys” to a group that included a trans woman; that would be a micro-aggression. This begs the question, why does gender need to be a part of a greeting in the first place?

So much of our language centers on gender, which is assumed to be cisgender. Cisgender is when your gender identity matches what was assigned at birth by doctors. Transgender is when you gender does not match what was assigned at birth. Often we use language unconsciously, like muscle memory. It can be difficult to change phrasing that is instinctual. It's not your fault if you didn't know, but consider this your education on the subject and a challenge to do better going forward. We should all be intentional about our language, because we do not want to cause harm to others.

## Ways to greet a group of people

- #### Hey y’all / you all

  People not from the south-eastern states have my full permission to get over their issue with this. This is the _best_ gender inclusive greeting that rolls off the tongue. Our language should evolve, and yankees saying y’all should be normalized.

- #### Hello there

  I love this one because of the Star Wars reference (we are staff for a cat named General Grievous) [MEME](https://media.giphy.com/media/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/source.gif)

- #### Hey folks / folx

  Side note: [Folx](https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/folx/) is a variation of the word folks that is meant to be a gender neutral way to refer to members of the LGBTQIA+ community. It comes from Lantinx with is a gender neutral way to say Latino or Latina.

- #### Hey people / persons
- #### Hey humans
- #### Hey everybody
- #### Hey somebodies

### A few I use among friends

## One more thing: replace other gendered phrasing

If you use the following phrases, note how they are very gendered.

- Hey girl / boy
- You go, girl / boy
- You’re my girl / boy
- That’s my girl / boy
- My girls / boys

Instead, you can say

- #### Hey person / human / friend / mate
- #### You go person / human / friend / mate
- #### You’re my person / human / friend / mate
- #### That’s my person / human / friend / mate
- #### My persons / humans / friends / mates

### Gender neutral way to say Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss

**Mx** pronounced “mix”

### Gender neutral ways to say Sir/Madame

- Excuse me
- Pardon me
- Hello there
