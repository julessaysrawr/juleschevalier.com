Most days I hit a point where I have been doing [Deep Work](http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) for several hours and I am hitting a point of diminishing returns. That’s when I take a break and pick a few from the list above. Taking the time to do this results in the ability to gain another deep working session before my willpower evaporates for the day.
