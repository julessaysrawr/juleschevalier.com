### Thoughts & Tips

This is my favorite breakfast.  My body doesn't process grains well, so this is a recipe that feels special and I use regularly.  

If you're paying attention to FODMAPs, just use a banana before it goes ripe (minimal brown spots).  This will still work is a slight green banana.

I usually put a slice of butter on top.  If I am feeling extra special, I'll put maple syrup on as well.  Though is it sweet enough just as it is for my palate.
