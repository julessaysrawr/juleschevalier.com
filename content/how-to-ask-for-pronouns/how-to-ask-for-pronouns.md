## Share Yours When Introducing Yourself
> “Hi, I’m Jules and my pronouns are they/them.  What’s you name and pronouns?”

## Share Yours After the Fact
> “Hey friend, I’m going through all my friends / colleagues / any group to make sure I am using the right pronouns.  Mine are they/them, what are yours?


You should always share yours first, to show that you are both sharing so the focus isn’t all on the trans person.
