## Share Yours When Introducing Yourself

> “Hi, I’m Jules and my pronouns are they/them. What’s you name and pronouns?”

## Share Yours After the Fact

> “Hey friend, I’m going through all my friends / colleagues / any group to make sure I am using the right pronouns. Mine are they/them, what are yours?

You should always share yours first, so it makes the discomfort around sharing pronouns and gender more equal for everyone.
