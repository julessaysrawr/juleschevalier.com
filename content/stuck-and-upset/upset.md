What is troubling me?

Am I struggling with wanting to change something and can’t get perfection?

Don’t let perfection be the enemy of better.

It’s about progress, not perfection.

What’s your goal?

Can you take a small or several small steps in the desired direction?

Change happens little by little, just like habits you build over time.

Sometimes you need to slow down, that’s okay.

_In order to do any of this, you need to take care of yourself first. Everything else can wait._

## Here are ways I change my state:

Have you eaten in the last 3 hours?

Have you showered today?

Have you gotten dressed?

Have you moved your body _in a way that feels good_?

Do you need a nap?

Go get some sunshine.

Practice gratitude..

- For how far you’ve come
- For the many privileges you have
- For the blessings of your current life
- For your health
- For your relationships
- For your passions
- For the many ways you’ve grown
- For the ways you’ve contributed to others
- For yourself, and the things you like about yourself
