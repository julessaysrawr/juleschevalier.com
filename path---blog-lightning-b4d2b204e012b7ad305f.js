The sky can be pitch black, no clouds in the sky, and then as if the god of thunder himself appeared, a strike so violent it lights up the sky as if it is daylight.  Suddenly, in an instant, you can see things clear as day.</p>\n<p>Life can be like that too.  You can be going along, focusing on where you are, living  you life.  Life has it’s ups and downs.  You settle into a rhythm.  Maybe it’s comfortable, maybe it’s not quite, but it’s manageable.  Then suddenly, YOU ARE ALIVE.  Everything is heightened, something has shocked you awake.  Then every single detail is either alive or background.  Nothing matters more that keeping that spark.  </p>\n<p>Breathe in, breathe out.  Breathe in, breathe out.  You are here.  Now.  In this moment.  If nothing ever comes from the spark, if there is no second strike, no third, no forth, you have this moment.  This gift where you feel alive and can see and feel what you want and don’t want so clearly.  What you had settled for, suddenly becomes yesterday’s news that you have moved on from.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes pushing for more, to keep going is what you need.  Sometimes it isn’t.  But this feeling, the high of opportunity and possibility, of a new beginning, of hope.  Feel this now.  Cherish it, savor it.  Don’t rush ahead, enjoy the anticipation.  Refill your cup.  There will be time enough for the work, so don’t rush past this.  Celebrate it and let it fully expand.  After all, it is the journey towards the goal that is remembered, not the moment when the goal is complete.</p>\n<p><em>Congratulations, you have just unlocked a new quest line.</em></p>",frontmatter:{date:"May 25, 2018",path:"/blog/lightning",title:"Lightning"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
